1)	These are basic predictive models for used for predicting the chances of corruption in a particular place based on parameters like literacy rate, crime rate, poverty rate etc
2)	There are 3 files model.py which has the neural network, train.py which is used for training the model and test.py which used to display the results.
3)	As the dataset will be made during real time the files have been made such that it can feed the required parameters to the model in real time for training
4)	For starting we have just taken 4-5 parameters and we'll feed that to the network for 4-5 states.
5)	You may not be needed to run train.py and model.py as it is already done and values are stored
6)	Running test.py right now shows chances of corruption in Bengaluru.
