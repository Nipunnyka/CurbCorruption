This is a solution and an implementation of a problem statement of the Smart India Hackathon 2020. This solution focussed on combating bribery and digital policing. 

Our team developed a working web and mobile app which centered on the following aspects:

1) A reporting system which allows users to report the incidents where they were asked to pay a bribe.
2) A bribe addressing system where users can report the incidents where they had to pay a bribe.
