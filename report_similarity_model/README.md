## Description 
To ensure reliable anonymous reports, we check the similarity of reports obtained from the same localtion in similar departments against non anonymous reports and grant them a *degree of reliability*

## Machine Dependencies
1. Keras
2. NLTK
3. gensim
4. Pandas, numpy, matplotlib pyhton libraries
5. download this [file](https://www.kaggle.com/sandreds/googlenewsvectorsnegative300) to run on local machine

## Getting Started
1. run this [ipynb file](https://github.com/Nipunnyka/CurbCorruption/blob/master/report_similarity_model/kernel1ba4582600.ipynb) on jupyter notebook 
2. move train.csv into the file path as this is the testing data
3. enter the test report as a csv file.
